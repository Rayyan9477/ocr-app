# OCR API Syntax Fixes Summary

This document provides a summary of the fixes made to resolve syntax errors and issues in the OCR processing application.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. OCR API Route Syntax Errors
- Fixed missing semicolons in route.ts file at lines 487 and 560
- Resolved function structure issues
- Fixed export statement handling at line 725
- Corrected function declarations and properly handled exported HTTP methods

### 2. Type Errors and Missing Functions
- Added the missing `extractPotentialPathsFromError` function to ocr-output-helper.ts
- Fixed type issues in ocr-retry.ts including proper handling of possibly undefined values
- Fixed retry mechanism return type usage in route.ts
- Added safety checks for process handling in killProcess functions

### 3. Fallback Handling
- Improved error handling during OCR processing 
- Enhanced fallback file creation mechanism
- Fixed the function signature for checkForFallbackOutput() to match its usage

### 4. Component Issues
- Fixed the Rotate icon import in command-builder-new.tsx (changed to Rotate3D)
- Updated notification variant in page.tsx from "destructive" to "error"

### 5. Service Layer
- Fixed ocr-service.ts issues with node-fetch by using native fetch API
- Implemented proper timeout handling using AbortController
- Added proper TypeScript types and error handling
- Created a missing logger module

## Testing

Created the test-ocr-api-endpoint.sh script to validate that the OCR API endpoint is working correctly. The script:
1. Checks if the API route is accessible
2. Creates a test PDF file if needed
3. Submits the test file to the OCR endpoint
4. Validates the response and reports on success or failure
5. Provides detailed error information if processing fails

## Next Steps

1. Run the test-ocr-api-endpoint.sh script to verify the API is working correctly
2. Monitor server logs during OCR processing to catch any runtime errors
3. Process test PDF files to ensure fallback mechanisms work correctly
4. Verify integration with the frontend components
5. Consider adding additional error handling for edge cases
